## How to Run
#### 1. Hardware requirement
##### Computer
  * this software is tested based on PC with metrics: 2.60Ghz CPU + 8G Memory + Win11 (no graphic card)
  * if with less hardware resource, e.g.2.0Ghz CPU + 4G Memory + Any OS, it should also be alright to run indicators in tutorial. But if you write own advanced indicators, or connect to new device, then it may change hardware requirements.
##### Supported Devices
  * support for two hardware devices are implemented in sample code: Muse 2016 and NeuroSky TGAM
  * "mne-lsl player" can be used as device simulator.

#### 2.Setup Environment
    conda create -n py12_env python=3.12
    conda activate py12_env
    conda install --file requirements.txt

#### 3.Execute below commands in two different anaconda prompts
    mne-lsl player "../tools-LSLstream_providers/sample_data_SC4001E0-PSG.edf"
    python main_window.py
