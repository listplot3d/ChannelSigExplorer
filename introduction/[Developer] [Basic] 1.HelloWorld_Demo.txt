1.Setup Environment
    conda create -n py12_env python=3.12
    conda activate py12_env
    conda install --file requirements.txt

2.Execute below commands in two different anaconda prompt
   mne-lsl player "../tools-LSLstream_providers/sample_data_SC4001E0-PSG.edf"

Note: the first-time launch may take a few seconds to compile, but later
launches will be fairly fast.
