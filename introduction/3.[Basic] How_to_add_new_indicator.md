python files in ./indicators folder will be listed in application GUI. So just 
put new python file there will create a new indicator.

the easiest way to compose content of an indicator, is to copy/rename a existing
indicator file, and do some modifications.
If lucky, everything works like a charm. 

If you want to understand the underlying data structure and logic flow (e.g. 
while in diagnosis), then taking a look at the Design_doc_for_diagnostics would 
speed things up well.

that's it.
